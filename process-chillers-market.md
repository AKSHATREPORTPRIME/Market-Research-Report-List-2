<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Process Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Process chillers are used in various industries to cool down industrial processes and maintain stable temperatures. There are two main types: air-cooled and water-cooled chillers. Air-cooled chillers work by transferring heat from the process to the surrounding air through a process of convection. They are easier to install and require less maintenance but are less efficient in hotter climates. Water-cooled chillers, on the other hand, use water as a cooling medium and exchange heat through a process of conduction. Although they are more expensive and complex to install, they are more efficient and suitable for high-temperature applications.</p></p>
