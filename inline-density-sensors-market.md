<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inline Density Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inline density sensors are devices used to measure the density of liquids or solids in industrial processes. Contact type sensors require physical contact with the material being measured, for example, by immersing a probe into a liquid. Non-contact type sensors, on the other hand, can measure density without touching the material. These sensors use various technologies such as ultrasonic waves or radiation to determine the density of the substance. Both contact and non-contact types of density sensors are widely used in industries such as food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum.</p></p>
