<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underground Mining Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Longwall</li><li>Room and Pillar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The underground mining equipment market can be classified into two main types: longwall mining equipment and room and pillar mining equipment. </p><p>Longwall mining equipment is used in coal mining and involves the removal of coal in long panels or slices using a shearer that moves back and forth across the coal face. This method is highly efficient and ensures the maximum recovery of coal.</p><p>On the other hand, room and pillar mining equipment is used in mining operations where the ore body is relatively thin, and pillars of ore are left to support the roof. This method creates separate 'rooms' and 'pillars' and is commonly used in salt, potash, and other soft minerals mining.</p></p>
