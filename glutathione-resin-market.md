<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glutathione Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oxidized Glutathione</li><li>Reduced Glutathione</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Glutathione Resin Market comprises two types: Oxidized Glutathione and Reduced Glutathione. Oxidized Glutathione is the form of glutathione with an additional oxygen molecule, making it less desirable for most applications due to reduced antioxidant properties. On the other hand, Reduced Glutathione is the preferred form as it acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. This form is widely used in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industries, proving its significance in various sectors.</p></p>
