<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Vacuum Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li><li>Momentum Transfer Pumps</li><li>Entrapment Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial vacuum pump market consists of three main types: positive displacement pumps, momentum transfer pumps, and entrapment pumps. Positive displacement pumps work by trapping gases in a cavity and then expelling them, creating a vacuum. Momentum transfer pumps rely on high-speed rotating blades or jets of gas to remove gas molecules. Entrapment pumps use a cold surface to freeze gas molecules, which then stick to the surface and create a vacuum. These different types cater to various industrial needs and applications.</p></p>
