<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Latte Instant Coffee Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spray-drying</li><li>Freeze-drying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Latte instant coffee is available in two market types: spray-drying and freeze-drying. Spray-drying involves spraying the liquid coffee extract into hot air, evaporating the moisture and resulting in fine particles. This method is cost-effective, but may slightly affect the flavor and aroma. In freeze-drying, the liquid coffee is frozen and then slowly dehydrated under low pressure, preserving the flavor and aroma better. Though freeze-drying is a more expensive process, it produces a high-quality coffee product that dissolves quickly when mixed with hot water.</p></p>
