<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nickel Aluminum Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plane Target</li><li>Rotating Target</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The nickel aluminum target market can be classified into two types: plane target and rotating target. A plane target is a flat surface where materials are applied evenly, delivering a consistent amount of the nickel aluminum alloy for deposition. This type is commonly used in thin film coating processes to ensure uniform coverage. On the other hand, a rotating target involves a cylindrical shape that rotates during deposition. This mechanism allows for more efficient and even distribution of the nickel aluminum alloy on the substrate, making it ideal for applications that require high precision and uniformity.</p></p>
