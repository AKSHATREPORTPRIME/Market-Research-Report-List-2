<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Trap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ball Float Type</li><li>Semi Ball Float Type</li><li>Lever Float Type</li><li>Inverted Bucket Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mechanical trap market encompasses four major types: the ball float type, semi ball float type, lever float type, and inverted bucket type. The ball float type trap consists of a hollow ball that rises and falls with the water level, controlling the opening and closing of the valve. The semi ball float type operates similarly, but with a semi-ball instead. The lever float type uses a lever mechanism to control the valve, while the inverted bucket type utilizes an inverted bucket that opens and closes the valve based on the condensate level.</p></p>
