<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Ratio Transfer Case Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Planetary Gear Drive</li><li>Ordinary Gear Drive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low ratio transfer case market consists of two main types: planetary gear drive and ordinary gear drive. Planetary gear drive transfer cases utilize a complex system of gears and shafts to transfer power from the engine to the wheels, providing multiple gear reduction options for improved torque and off-road capabilities. Conversely, ordinary gear drive transfer cases employ a simpler gear system with fewer components, offering fewer gear reduction options. Both types cater to different needs and preferences within the automotive industry, providing varying levels of performance and functionality.</p></p>
