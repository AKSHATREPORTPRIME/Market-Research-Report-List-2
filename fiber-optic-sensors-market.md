<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li><li>Extrinsic Fiber-Optic Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Fiber optic sensors are categorized into two main types: intrinsic fiber-optic sensors and extrinsic fiber-optic sensors. Intrinsic sensors use the fiber optic cable itself as the sensing element, measuring properties such as temperature, strain, or pressure through physical changes in the cable. Extrinsic sensors, on the other hand, use an external sensor along with the fiber optic cable to measure parameters like temperature or pressure. Both types find applications in various industries including aerospace, oil and gas, medical, and manufacturing for precise and reliable measurements.</p></p>
