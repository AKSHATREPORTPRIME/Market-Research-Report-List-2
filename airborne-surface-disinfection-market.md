<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Surface Disinfection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vaporized Type</li><li>Fogging Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airborne surface disinfection market includes two types - vaporized type and fogging type. In the vaporized type, a liquid disinfectant is converted into a gaseous state and then released into the air. This helps in spreading the disinfectant evenly and reaching areas that are difficult to access. Fogging type, on the other hand, involves dispersing small droplets of the liquid disinfectant through the use of specialized equipment. This creates a fog-like mist that can easily cover larger areas and provide effective disinfection. Both types aim to kill germs, viruses, and bacteria on surfaces to maintain a clean and safe environment.</p></p>
