<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Grids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diffraction Light Grids</li><li>Reflex Light Grids</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Light grids are used in various industries for object detection and measurement. Diffraction light grids employ a photoelectric receiver and a light emitter to detect objects passing through the grid by analyzing the interruption of a light beam. Reflex light grids, on the other hand, use a single device housing both the receiver and the emitter. They work based on the principle of retro-reflection, where the light beam reflects directly back into the receiver when it encounters an object. These market types cater to different requirements in object detection and offer diverse solutions for industries.</p></p>
