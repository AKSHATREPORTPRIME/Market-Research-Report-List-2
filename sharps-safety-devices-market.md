<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sharps Safety Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retractable Safety</li><li>Passive Safety</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sharps safety devices refer to tools designed to prevent needlestick injuries and protect healthcare workers from exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The market for sharps safety devices can be categorized into two types: retractable safety devices and passive safety devices. Retractable safety devices have a mechanism that withdraws the needle into the device after use, reducing the risk of accidental needlestick injuries. Passive safety devices, on the other hand, use a shielding mechanism to cover the needle once it is removed from the patient, minimizing the potential for injuries during disposal. Both types aim to promote safer healthcare practices by minimizing sharps-related injuries.</p></p>
