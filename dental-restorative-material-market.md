<p><strong>The Dental Restorative Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Amalgam</li><li>Resin Based Composite</li><li>Glass Ionomer</li><li>Resin Modified Glass Ionomer</li><li>Porcelain-Fused-to-Metal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental restorative material market consists of various types, including amalgam, resin-based composite, glass ionomer, resin-modified glass ionomer, and porcelain-fused-to-metal. Amalgam is a silver-colored material that contains a mixture of metals, providing high durability but a noticeable appearance. Resin-based composites are tooth-colored materials that offer excellent cosmetic results but may not be as durable as amalgam. Glass ionomer materials are a combination of glass powder and acid, providing good aesthetic and adhesive properties. Resin-modified glass ionomer combines glass ionomer with resin, improving its strength and wear resistance. Porcelain-fused-to-metal combines porcelain and metal, providing both strength and aesthetics.</p></p>
