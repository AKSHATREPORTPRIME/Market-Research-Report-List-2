<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Titanium Dioxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfuric Acid Industrial Titanium Dioxide</li><li>Chlorination Industrial Titanium Dioxide</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial titanium dioxide is categorized into two main types: sulfuric acid industrial titanium dioxide and chlorination industrial titanium dioxide. Sulfuric acid industrial titanium dioxide is produced by treating the mineral ilmenite with sulfuric acid and subsequently calcining it. This process results in a lower titanium dioxide purity but a higher production yield. On the other hand, chlorination industrial titanium dioxide is obtained by subjecting titanium tetrachloride to chlorination reactions, resulting in a higher purity product but with a lower production yield. Both types find applications in various industries such as paints, coatings, plastics, and papers.</p></p>
