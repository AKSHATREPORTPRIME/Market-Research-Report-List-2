<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autorefractometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic Keratometer</li><li>Manual Keratometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Autorefractometers are devices used to measure the refractive error of an individual's eyes. There are two types: automatic keratometers and manual keratometers. Automatic keratometers are advanced and computerized, allowing for quick and precise measurements without manual adjustments. On the other hand, manual keratometers require manual adjustments by an ophthalmologist or optometrist, making them less automated. Both types are used in the field of ophthalmology to determine the prescription needed for eyeglasses or contact lenses based on the curvature of the cornea.</p></p>
