<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrostatic Wafer Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulomb Type</li><li>Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electrostatic Wafer Chuck market consists of two main types: Coulomb Type and Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type. In the Coulomb Type, the chuck utilizes Coulomb forces to hold the wafer in place. It creates an electric field between the chuck and the wafer, resulting in electrostatic attraction. On the other hand, the JR Type utilizes a combination of Coulomb and Johnsen-Rahbek forces. In this type, the chuck also applies a magnetic field to generate frictional forces, enhancing the holding capacity of the wafer during high-speed rotations.</p></p>
