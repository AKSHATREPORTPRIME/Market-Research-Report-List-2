<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubberized Asphalt Concrete (RAC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asphalt-rubber</li><li>Terminal Blend</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rubberized Asphalt Concrete (RAC) is a type of pavement material that incorporates shredded rubber from recycled tires into traditional asphalt concrete. There are two main types of RAC on the market: Asphalt-rubber and Terminal Blend. Asphalt-rubber is created by blending hot asphalt cement and crumb rubber modifier, resulting in a more flexible and durable pavement. Terminal Blend RAC involves blending asphalt cement, crumb rubber, and a specific type of oil called terpolymer oil at the terminal before mixing with the aggregate. Both types offer improved durability, reduced road noise, and enhanced skid resistance.</p></p>
